Description: Provides access to low-level operating system mechanisms for
    performing atomic operations on shared data structures. Mutexes provide
    shared and exclusive locks. Semaphores act as counters. Message queues
    move text strings from one process to another. All these interprocess
    communication (IPC) tools can optionally block with or without a timeout.
    Implemented using the cross-platform 'boost' 'C++' library
    <https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/interprocess/>.
